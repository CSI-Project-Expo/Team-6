## 📌 Project Overview
SmartCanteen is a digital food ordering and token-based pickup system developed for the CSI Project Expo. The project aims to reduce long queues and waiting time in college canteens by enabling students to pre-order food and track their order status in real time. The system also provides an admin dashboard for efficient menu and order management.
